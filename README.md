# dotfiles

My dotfiles are managed with [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm).  The [thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com/) blog post for `rcm` is [here](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/rcm-for-rc-files-in-dotfiles-repos).


## Getting Started

### Get `rcm`

Instructions from the `rcm` [README](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm).

#### macOS

```sh
# install rcm
brew tap thoughtbot/formulae
brew install rcm
```

#### Ubuntu (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

```sh
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:martin-frost/thoughtbot-rcm
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install rcm
```

### Get dotfiles

Now that we have `rcm`, clone my dotfiles.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/curtisalexander/dotfiles.git ~/code/dotfiles
```
